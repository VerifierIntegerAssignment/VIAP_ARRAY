Verifier Integer Assignment Program(VIAP) translates a program to first-order logic with
quantifiers on natural numbers following the method proposed recently by [Professor Fangzhen Lin](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~flin/). Once translated to a first-order theory, properties of the program can then be proved using induction (because of the quantifiers on natural numbers) and other methods.
